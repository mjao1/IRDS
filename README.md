# facial-recognition-turret
A laser turret guided by facial recognition. The facial recognition is coded in python, which sends either recognized or unrecognized face coordinates from an external webcam to an Arduino IDE where they are converted to corresponding angles and updated constantly for two servo motors. The servo structures and electronics housing are designed in CAD and 3D printed. The goal of this project was to develop a cohesive, portable turret capable of recognizing and pointing to faces based on checking images from folders containing known faces.
